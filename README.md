üîÅ Study Procedure

The study follows a structured flow:

Study Introduction

Participants are welcomed and given an explanation of the study's purpose, procedures, and expectations.

Informed Consent

Before starting, participants sign an IRB-approved consent form to confirm voluntary participation.

Pre-Study Questionnaires
Participants complete:

The ABC Scale to measure their confidence in maintaining balance

A demographic survey (age, gender, VR experience, etc.)

Baseline Task (No VR)
Participants perform a standing visual observation task without wearing a VR headset. This provides baseline balance data from a non-immersive condition.

VR Experimental Tasks
Participants perform three separate VR trials while standing:

VR Visual Exploration task

VR Gameplay task

The order of trials is counterbalanced across participants to avoid order effects like fatigue or learning.

Post-Study Questionnaires
After completing all VR tasks, participants fill out:

SSQ ‚Äì Simulator Sickness Questionnaire

GEQ ‚Äì Game Experience Questionnaire

SPEQ ‚Äì Spatial Presence Experience Questionnaire

üéÆ Experimental Conditions in VR

Each VR trial is performed under varying sensory and environmental settings to study how different conditions affect balance:

1. Audio Condition

No Audio: The VR environment has no sound.

2. CoP Condition

Low

Medium

High

3. Spatial Condition

Low

Medium

High

All these conditions are systematically varied and counterbalanced, so each participant experiences a unique but controlled set of combinations.

üìä Data Collected

Sensor Data from the HMD and controllers:

Head position, rotation, velocity

Controller motion

CoP (Center of Pressure) trajectories from a balance board 

Questionnaire responses about balance confidence, simulator sickness, immersion, and enjoyment
